Java is a high-level programming language that was developed by James Gosling in the year 1982. It is based on the principles of object-oriented programming and can be used to develop large-scale applications.Â 
To create a program in Java, we need source code, compiler and interpreter. a executes the one statement after other in the order they were written. 
For Programming in Java, we need to know about classes, objects, variables, methods, primitive and non primitive types etc.
Java is a platform independent language.
Java is an Object Oriented language. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which can contain data and code to manipulate that data. 
OOPS Concepts:
Classes & Objects:
A class is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of objects.
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity that can be created, manipulated, and used in the program
Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism that enables a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
